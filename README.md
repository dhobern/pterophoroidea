# Data files for Catalogue of World Pterophoroidea

The CSV files in this repository together form the contents of a [Catalogue of Life Data Package](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp) (CoLDP file).

This CoLDP dataset is for the [Catalogue of World Pterophoroidea](https://pterophoroidea.hobern.net), a continuously maintained checklist of the plume moths (Pterophoridae) and the few moths assigned to the family Macropiratidae. The dataset derives from the work of [Cees Gielis](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cees_Gielis) in developing the 2003 catalogue, [*Pterophoroidea & Alucitoidea (Lepidoptera)* (_World Catalogue of Insects_ 4)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270723918). Cees subsequently maintained the catalogue of Pterophoroidea as a word processor document. This was restructured in 2018 as v1.0 of this dataset and added to the [Catalogue of Life](http://www.catalogueoflife.org/) as a component for this group of moths.

These files are added here to enable versioning and tracking. The [CoLDPUtils](https://github.com/dhobern/CoLDPUtils) repository contains tools for manipulating these files.
